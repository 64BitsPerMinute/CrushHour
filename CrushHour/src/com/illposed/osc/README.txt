This package is an OSC library that we are relying on to talk to the Max MSP program that our GUI 
is written in. We decided not to add our own comments to the code as it is an independent library 
that we are utilizing, much as we would any other Java Library, rather than a real part of the 
algorithm we wrote to solve Rush Hour puzzles, or the GUI that we wrote to relay solutions.
